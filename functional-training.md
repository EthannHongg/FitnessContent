# Is "Functional Training" Legit?
---
In recent years, the fitness industry has seen the resurgence of "functional training," a concept that aims to enhance physical abilities for everyday tasks. However, the lack of a universally agreed-upon definition of "functional training" has led to confusion and debate. This article examines the key points surrounding functional training, focusing on its results and implications rather than delving into the intricacies of research.

### Lack of a Clear Definition
Functional training lacks a concrete definition, making it challenging to distinguish from traditional strength, power, flexibility, or endurance training. This ambiguity hinders its evaluation and comparison with other training methods.

### Core Stabilization Controversy
Claims that core stabilization exercises and unstable surface training are superior to traditional strength training for physical function lack substantial scientific support. The effectiveness of many core stability exercises remains untested.

### Unstable Surface Training
Training on unstable surfaces, often promoted in functional training, lacks specificity and may compromise force production. It is inconsistent with the principles of progressive overload, a key component of effective resistance training.

### Simplify for Inclusivity
Given the complexity and lack of clarity in functional training, simplicity in resistance training is advocated. Traditional resistance exercises have documented benefits in improving healthspan, making them a valuable choice.

## Practical Recommendations

- Exercise selection should align with the client's goals, abilities, and preferences.
- While variety can be beneficial, training programs should maintain purpose and goal orientation.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or excessive variation that may hinder progress tracking.
- Consistency in training is essential for tracking and achieving fitness goals.
- Traditional resistance training is effective for improving muscle mass, strength, and central nervous system adaptations, which are crucial for daily activities.

In conclusion, the concept of functional training remains ill-defined, and its practical utility is questionable. Fitness enthusiasts should prioritize established principles of resistance training for meaningful results and improved physical function.
